my slightly scripted osx laptop setup.

Note - this is specific to moi.. fork & edit unles you want to be me.

 - If you don't have xcode (or command line tools) install via `xcode-select --install`
 - Run 'setup'
 - Run 'install'

If you have previosuly saved configs with Mackup (https://github.com/lra/mackup)
restore with:
